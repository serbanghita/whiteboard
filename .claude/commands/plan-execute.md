description: Execute the user's plan that has been iteratively refined
---

You are executing the user's plan that has been iteratively refined.

To do this, follow these steps precisely:

1. Read `.claude/plan-critique-config.json` and get `plansFolder` path from settings.
   If the file doesn't exist or `plansFolder` is not set:
   Respond with "No plans folder configured. Run `/plan-create` first to set up."
2. Scan `[plansFolder]/` for subdirectories (each subdirectory is a plan).
   Exclude `archived/` folder and any files, only list plan directories.
   If no plan folders exist: Respond with "No plans found. Create one with `/plan-create`".
   If `currentPlan` is set and that folder exists, show it as default.
3. Ask the user to select a plan, present the list of available plans.
   If only one plan exists, auto-select it and inform user.
   If there's a current plan, mark it as "(current)".
   Example:
   ```
   Available plans:
   1. add-user-authentication (current)
   2. refactor-database-layer
   3. implement-caching

   Which plan would you like to execute? [1-3]
   ```
4. Update `.claude/plan-critique-config.json` to set `currentPlan` to the selected plan slug.
   Preserve all other settings.
5. Check prerequisites:
   - If `[plansFolder]/[selected-plan]/plan.md` does not exist: Respond with "No plan.md found."
   - If `plan.md` is empty: Respond with "Plan file is empty. Run /plan-critique first."
6. Check for existing execution state. If `[plansFolder]/[selected-plan]/execution-state.json` exists,
   read it and prompt: "Previous execution found at step [X]. Resume or restart?"
   Wait for user response before proceeding.
7. Review supporting files in the `[plansFolder]/[selected-plan]/` folder. The user may have placed
   SQL queries, text snippets, images, or other reference materials relevant to execution.
8. Parse the plan into discrete, executable steps using this ordering strategy:
   - Independent tasks first: changes with no dependencies on other changes
   - Small to large: within independent tasks, order from smallest to largest scope
   - Dependent tasks after: once all independent tasks are ordered, add tasks that depend on them
   - Business priority: for tasks at the same dependency level, prioritize by business impact

   Example: If a plan has "Add utility function", "Create database migration", and "Update API endpoint
   (uses utility)", order as: 1) Add utility function, 2) Create database migration, 3) Update API endpoint
9. Present the steps to the user for confirmation:
   ```
   I've parsed your plan into the following steps:
   1. [Step description]
   2. [Step description]
   ...

   Do you want me to proceed with execution?
   ```
10. Execute each step sequentially:
    - Before each step, update execution-state.json with current progress
    - Ask for explicit user permission before high-risk operations:
      - Database migrations or schema changes
      - Deleting files or directories
      - Modifying configuration files
      - External API calls with side effects
      - Any irreversible operations
    - Execute the step
    - Log results to execution-log.md
    - On error: Stop execution, save state, and report the failure
11. On successful completion:
    - Update execution log with final summary
    - Delete execution-state.json
    - Inform user: "Plan executed successfully. Run `/plan-archive` to archive this plan."

Notes:

- Always pause on errors, never continue past a failed step automatically
- Keep the execution log updated in real-time
- Be explicit about what changes are being made at each step
- If resuming, skip already-completed steps
- Reference any supporting files in the plan folder as needed during execution

## Execution Log Format

Write to `[plansFolder]/[selected-plan]/execution-log.md`:

```markdown
# Execution Log: [Plan Title]

Started: [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS]

---

## Step 1: [Step description]

Result: [COMPLETED | FAILED | SKIPPED]

Output:
[relevant output, changes made, or error messages]

---

## Summary

- Total steps: [X]
- Completed: [Y]
- Failed: [Z]
- Skipped: [W]

[If failed or partial:]
Execution stopped at step [N]. Run `/plan-execute` to resume.
```

---

## Execution State Format

Write to `[plansFolder]/[selected-plan]/execution-state.json`:

```json
{
  "planTitle": "[title]",
  "totalSteps": 5,
  "currentStep": 2,
  "completedSteps": [0, 1],
  "failedStep": null,
  "startedAt": "2026-01-12T10:30:00Z",
  "lastUpdated": "2026-01-12T10:35:00Z"
}
```
